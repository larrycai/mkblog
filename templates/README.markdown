## Larry Cai

I use the template from https://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com, please give credits to him.

This is the Jekyll source for Larry Cai's blog and website, [Larry Cai](http://larrycai.github.com/). It makes some nice use of Jekyll's liquid templating system (see blog.html) and uses Javscript to pull information from GitHub for the open-source section.
